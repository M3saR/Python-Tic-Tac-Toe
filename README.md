# Python-Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Python that I created to practice my programming skills. You can use this code to learn Python basics. If you have any questions, please write them in the comments and I will try to answer them. I would also appreciate any opinions or tips that you have.
